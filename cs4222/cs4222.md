# CS4222 Summary Notes
### Introduction
- Propagation Modes
    1. Ground-wave propagation: follows contour of earth, long distance, up to 2MHz frequency.
    2. Sky-wave propagation: Signal reflection from ionized layer of atmosphere. Hops back and forth. 3 - 30 MHz. Max 30MHz due to need for signal reflection.
    3. Line-of-sight propagation: No reflection. Communicate with satellite: $>$ 30MHz. Communicate to other ground towers: with effective LOS.
- Max distance for LOS Propagation: $3.57(\sqrt{Kh_1} + \sqrt{Kh_2})$ where
    - $h_1, h_2$ = heights of antenna 1,2\\
    - $K$ = adjustment factor due to refraction ($\approx$ 4/3).
- **Free Space Propagation Model** for LoS path: $P_r = G_r G_t (\frac{c}{4\pi f_c d})^\alpha P_t$
    - $f_c$ is center frequency in Hz
    - c is speed of light
    - d is the distance between transmitter and receiver
    - $\alpha$ is the path loss component
    - G is antenna gain.
- Other things constant, longer distance = higher loss. Higher frequency higher loss, but can be compensated with better antenna gain. Signal quality loss also depends on other factors like atmospheric absorption - e.g. water causes greatest absorption at f = 22GHz.
- Antenna: dipole antenna or half-wave dipole. Use $v = f(2\lambda)$.
    - $v = 3 * 10^8$
    - Refer to lecture 1 slides for table.
- Antenna gain: power output in a particular direction, as compared to that produced by a perfectly omni-directional antenna: $G = \frac{4 \pi A_e}{\lambda^2} = \frac{4 \pi f^2 A_e}{c^2}$
    - G = antenna gain
    - $A_e$ = effective area
    - f = carrier frequency
    - c = speed of light
    - $\lambda$ = carrier wavelength.
- Path loss (in dB): $10 log \frac{P_t}{P_r}$
    - Simplifies to $P_r \approx (\frac{d_0}{d})^\alpha P_t$.
    - Where $d_0$ is a reference supposedly smaller than any practical distance used.
    - Simplification just an approximation. Doesn't make sense when d is small. i.e. requires $d > d_0$
    - Implies a circular disk model for radio propagation. Not true in practice.
- Path loss exponent: dependent on environment. Due to factors like interference, material signal blocking, material resonance etc.
    - Environment | $\alpha$
      ------------|---------
      Free Space | 2
      Urban area Cellular radio | 2.7 - 3.5
      Shadowed urban cellular radio | 3 - 5
      In building LOS | 1.6 - 1.8
      Obstructed in building | 4 - 6
      Obstructed in factory | 2 - 3
- Multipath propagation
    - Need not be single direct LoS.
    - Reflection, diffraction, scattering etc
    - Signal can arrive at different phase - interference, ambiguity in signal
- Channel quality not a constant; Varies with time!
- **Shannon Capacity** for noisy channel: $C = B \log_2(1 + SNR)$.
    - C = Shannon Channel Capacity (bps)
    - B = Bandwidth (MHz)
    - SNR: Signal to noise ratio
    - SNR affected by power. Can be thought of as proportional to recived power.
- Conclusions
    - Increasing anything is not free.
    - Increase data rate <=> Decrease in range OR Increase in power
    - Increase bandwidth <=> Higher frequency required for contiguous BW
    - Improve design provides better gain, more efficient use of power. 

### Energy Consumption
- Power = Voltage * Current
    - Phones: Around 10-20Wh @ 5V / 3000mAh
    - Laptops: Around 40Wh @ 13-19V / 4000mAh
- Radio: Switch states to save power
    - Remember that switching states incur time / energy overhead
    - Can use multiple power states to tradeoff time/energy
    - WiFi: TX 280mA, RX 180mA, IDLE 10mA
    - ZigBee: TX 30mA, RX 18mA, IDLE 0.426mA
- Cellular: radio stays in high power states for longer period. Constant "tail behaviour" (repeatedly/infrequently sending small amount of data) incurs high overhead on cellular radio
- Display: power used by backlight for LED, which is constantly on whether image is light or dark. OLED uses less power when dark. Each pixel uses power and displays individually
- CPU: Can also be (almost) turned off when idle.
- Sensors: Use power, but less. Possible to save power by reducing sampling frequency or use better hardware. Camera & GPS uses significantly more power.

### Counting Steps
- Thresholding
    - Count a step if change in acceleration is greater than a threshold $\sigma$.
    - Problem: different location, orientation of sensor, different walking strength from person to person.
- Auto-correlation
    - Key idea: walking pattern is similar for the same person.
    - Observation is similar, just shifted by a time lag between observation.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/uxf674M.png)
- Auto-correlation: high level idea
    - Partition sensor readings into segments, each segment corresponding to 1 step. Then the correlation between each step should be high (close to 1)
    - Problem: how to define a step segment? What should be the value of t above? 
    - Answer: assume (for a normal person) t is between $t_{min}$ and $t_{max}$, say, 0.5 to 2s. Within the range, pick t such that correlation is maximized.
    - If auto-correlation > threshold (0.7), state = walking. Every t time corresponds to 2 steps.

### Wireless MAC Protocols
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ekk64Cv.png)

#### Random-access Protocols
ALOHA
- Sends when the node needs to send. If it hears an ACK, transmission was successful. Otherwise, re-send.
- Pros:
    - Minimum overhead
    - Low delay if network load is light
- Cons:
    - Long _vulnerable period_ (period where interference could occur)
- Analysis:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/21ZgY8H.png)
    - Where X is packet transmission time = maximum one-way propagation delay between any 2 stations.
    - Vulnerable period is 2X (another station sending at time > t-X will cause collision as ALOHA doesn't care about network status)
    - We can model the probability of successful transmission as a Poisson Distribution
    - $P(Y=k) = \frac{(2G)^k}{k!} e^{-2G}, k = 0,1,2,...$
        - $k=0$ means no other transmission.
        - $G$ is average number of new and re-transmitted packets in X seconds
    - Throughput $S = GP(k=0)$ since G is transmission rate $= Ge^{-2G}$
    - Maximum throughput at 1/2e = 0.18 = 18% of max possible bandwidth, when load G = 50%.

Slotted ALOHA
- Slotted version.
- Pros:
    - Low overhead
    - Low delay if network load is light
- Cons:
    - Still doesn't care about network status
- Improvements:
    - Shorter vulnerable period as compared to ALOHA. Vulnerable period = X.
    - $P(Y=k) = \frac{(G)^k}{k!} e^{-G}, k = 0,1,2,...$
        - Same definitions as above
    - $S = GP(k=0) = Ge^{-G}$.
    - Maximum throughput at 1/e = 36% when G = 1.

CSMA
- Sense carrier. If idle, send and wait for ACK. Assume collision if no ACK.

CSMA/CA
- Avoid collision.
- Defer transmission for a random interval t even if channel is clear.
- t = 0 to $W_{max}$ with **Binary Exponentiation Backoff**
    - After i-th collision, set $W_{max} = 2^i-1$ slots
    - Usually capped at $2^{10} - 1 = 1023$ slots.
- Pros:
    - Less collision (especially if network load is light)
    - Higher utilization
- Cons:
    - When network load is heavy, a lot of time spent in interference and backoff. High delay.

Hidden Terminal Problem
- A <--> B <--> C.
- A send can interfere with C sending, but A can't see C.
- Solution: Request-to-Send (RTS) / Confirm-to-Send (CTS)
    - Sense that channel is idle.
    - Send RTS (with duration) and wait for CTS.
    - All nodes that receive CTS not meant for itself will wait until after CTS period.
- But causes Exposed Terminal Problem

Exposed Terminal Problem
- A <-- B --- C --> D
- When B is transmitting to A, C can actually transmit to D as D is out of range of B and signal will not interfere.
- However, due to CSMA/CA, C will receive RTS from B. So C will not be able to send as it thinks the network is occupied.

Rate Asymmetry
- In CSMA/CA, each node sends same number of packets on average.
- Two nodes: 10Mbps and 150Mbps.
    - Let $x$ = number of packets sent by each node.
    - Let each packet consist of $k$ Mbits.
    - Total time = $\frac{kx}{10} + \frac{kx}{150} = \frac{16kx}{150}$ sec
    - Total data sent = $2kx$ Mbits
    - Total bitrate = $2kx \div \frac{16kx}{150} = 18.75$ Mbps
- $A+B$ nodes: A nodes of $i$ Mbps + B nodes of $j$ Mbps
    - Let $x$ = number of packets sent by each node.
    - Let each packet consist of $k$ Mbits.
    - Total time = $A * \frac{kx}{i} + B * \frac{kx}{j} = \frac{kx(Aj + Bi)}{ij}$ sec
    - Total data sent = $(A+B)kx$ Mbits
    - Total bitrate = $(A+B)kx \div \frac{kx(Aj + Bi)}{ij} = \frac{(A+B)ij}{Aj + Bi}$ Mbps
- Should allocate same transmission duration rather than number of packets.

Capture Effect
- Collision need not lead to packet loss. Receiver can receive signal from nearer station / much more powerful station.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/z2U7FXf.png)
- Nodes 1-3 added: the more stations, the lower reliability
- Add node 4 (much stronger / closer): becomes very reliable again as node 4 is "immune" to the collision. All packets in the system can be sent via node 4 --> high reliability

#### Controlled-access protocols
No collisions, only 1 (or few unrelated) channels can send.
Some overhead required for synchronization, coordination.

Reservation Access
- Make reservation before sending data
- Time slots divided into "bidding" and data slots. 
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/w61jTBY.png)
- No collisions
    - (But... How to reserve? Won't there be collision when reserving?)

Polling
- One primary station and many secondary stations
- SELECT: Primary station sends data to a secondary station
- POLL: Primary station asks secondary station if it has data to send.
- Primary station will poll secondary stations one by one.
- Designed to support interactive traffic e.g. VoIP??
- No collisions.

Token Passing
- Only nodes with token can send.
- Nodes pass token to next station (e.g. ring / dual ring / bus ring / star ring etc)

#### Channelization Protocols
- Divide the spectrum up: by time, by frequency, by orthorgonal codewords

FDMA
- Assign different frequency to each user.
- Static allocation: resource guaranteed & reserved
- User not TX/RX --> Frequency/bandwidth wasted.
- Slow to adjust to traffic demand changes

TDMA
- Assign timeslot to each user. Each timeslot is a "channel"
- Static allocation: resource guaranteed & reserved
- User can only send data (at accelerated rate) during its time slot, data can be buffered at sender/receiver and played back at original rate to "hide" TDMA peaky effects.
- User not TX/RX --> Bandwidth wasted.
- Slow to adjust to traffic demand changes
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/jLUmBUl.png)

Combine TDMA + FDMA
- Practical systems often combine both TDMA and FDMA.

OFDM
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/zkyWQRb.png)
- More efficient use of spectrum. Can pack frequencies closer. Orthorgonal because peak of one signal = zero of another signal.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CaaYkHD.png)
- No need to have spectrums entirely separate
- Also robust to selective fading
    - Some parts of the spectrum encounter more significant interference.

CDMA
- Use orthorgonal codes ("speak in different languages")

Spread Spectrum
- Use the entire spectrum, but send little data over each frequency.
- Mix with noise, increase resistance to interference, jamming and detection
Frequency Hopping
- Change different frequencies in pre-agreed order.
- Increase resistance to interference, jamming, detection
Direct Sequence
- Dot product with orthorgonal codeword
- Over the spectrum, signal can combine (due to interference) and still decryptable on receiver.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/gj9Skqz.png)
- Send 1 (1,-1,-1,1,-1,1) to user A
- Send -1 (-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1) to user B
- Interference effects --> sum = (0,-2,0,2,-2,0).
- sum * codeword of A = (0,2,0,2,2,0) --> sum = 6.
- sum * codeword of B = (0,-2,0,-2,-2,0) --> sum = -6.

### Duty Cycle MAC

Idle listening consumes a lot of power! How can we save power?
![](https://i.imgur.com/qQhO1Pq.png)
- ATIM: Announcement Traffic Indication Message: a message to tell nodes to keep awake
- Requires an always-on / constantly sending station (e.g. AP)
- What if all nodes are battery powered?

#### Asynchronous MAC: No agreement on when to wake up.

ALOHA w/ Preamble Sampling
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZpskvVF.png)
- Parameters:
    - Tp: preamble length
    - Ts: preamble sample length (probe length)
    - Td: data + ack length
- Nodes must send a preamble before sending data.
    - len(preamble) > max interval between sensing among all nodes
- Inefficient, as sender transmits long preamble for small amount of data.
- High latency to send packet (must wait for 1 Tp + Td)
- Low channel utilisation (max utilisation = Td / (Tp + Td))
- High energy consumption for sender
- BMAC is the implementation of Preamble Sampling in TinyOS.

XMAC
![](https://i.imgur.com/ddC8aGd.png)
- Improves over BMAC
- Strobed preambles with address of intended receiver.
- Receiver nodes wake up, listen to preamble and check if it is recipient.
    - If YES: Early ACK during preamble gap. Data transmission can occur immediately.
    - If NO: Go back to sleep and save power.
- ContikiMAC is the implementation of XMac in ContikiOS with 1 more optimisation
    - Instead of sending recipient ID, send recipient ID alongside data packets. Receive -> immediately can ACK.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4g8Esii.png)
    - RSSI: Received Signal Strength Indicator. (RSSI time = "warmup time")
    - CCA: Clear Channel Assessment (detect channel activity)

RI-MAC
- Receiver indicates its presence, rather than sender.
- Sender listens until it receives beacon from receiver.
- Less traffic on the network overall. No need to keep blasting preamble.
- More evenly distributed power usage between sender/receiver

#### Synchronous MAC: Wake up at the "same time"

SMAC
- 10% Duty Cycle: Each node listens for 100ms and sleeps for 900ms
- Problem: How to synchronize? Whose clock do we follow?
    - Start after a random interval. First node who wakes up is the leader.
    - Issue: boundary nodes can end up in different schedules
- Problem: Node goes to sleep if no data meant for it.
    - With RTS/CTS, this can be a problem.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/0Nd1alw.png)
    - Node C doesn't get to send RTS to node D because B has sent CTS to A.
    - Node D goes to sleep since it's not expecting data.
    
TMAC
- Solution: Future RTS mechanism: Extra dummy timeslot to allow FRTS requests.
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/rHIWb32.png)

DMAC
- Solution: exploit known topology information. At each time, only nodes of a specific layer can send.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/X4bQ4Ku.png)
- Reduce collision. However, if an event misses the cycle, it has to wait till next cycle.

WiseMAC
- If we know even more things: neighbour sleep/wake schedule, we can send exactly when receiver wakes up and do without preamble.
- How to learn this schedule? Put this information in ACK packet.
- Pros: perfect information, efficient use of bandwidth & energy
- Cons: Needs synchronization, overhead if nodes need to change wakeup schedule, node failure etc

PEGASIS
- Create a long linked-list. Nodes must pass all information along chain. Designed for static topology.

Anycast MAC
- Broadcast to multiple receivers (who can then pass on information)
- Increases probability that at least 1 forwarder will wake up in a short period. Decreases sender duty cycle

### Multi-channel MAC
- Increases throughput
    - Greater spatial diversity / more bandwidth
- Increases reliability
    - Less susceptible to failure on a single frequency band.

Control Channel
- Use a control channel to synchronize channel and time.
- Nodes switch to a different channel for data communication

Use all channels with pre-defined schedule (TSCH)
![](https://i.imgur.com/rz1PAab.png)

### Routing

Multi-hop routing vs single hop routing
- Multi-hop: More complex, but provides some benefits
    - Use less power overall. (by factor of $\frac{1}{N^{\alpha - 1}}$
        - N is number of nodes
        - $\alpha$ is path loss component = 2 in free space
    - Better reliability
        - More routes
        - Strictly better in terms of coverage

Routing metrics
- Hop Count
- Delay
- Reliability
- Energy consumption

#### Wireless Mesh Routing
- **Static** wireless nodes.
- Issues:
    - Interference
- Focus:
    - Selecting routes that minimize interference & error 

ETX
- Expected Number of Transmission
- ETX = $\sum_i \frac{1}{\text{PRR}_i}$
    - PRR: Packet Reception Ratio (< 1)

Tradeoffs when measuring link quality
- Need to send "dummy" packets that waste the bandwidth.
- Send S packets over a period of T seconds, calculate R: packets received.
- In ZigBee, each transmission takes 1ms.
- 100 test packets every 1s: 10% of bandwidth used by 1 node.
    - 10 nodes in network: eat up the entire bandwidth!
- 10 test packets every 100s: 0.01% of bandwidth used.
    - Takes 100s to notice link degredation!

Link Asymmetry
- Possible that A -> B is strong but B -> A is weak.

Which neighbours to keep?
- With limited memory, cannot keep all discovered neighbours.
- Keep top 6-10 neighbours.
- Might cause network partition.
    - {Room 1} <-/-> {Room 2}
    - Need to force some nodes to keep "bad" links.

Shortest Path Routing
- Routing based on shortest path metric: ETX, PRR, energy, delay etc

Tree-based Routing
- Select a root node.
- Root node performs broadcast. Neighbouring nodes obtain distance from root & link quality.
- Each node repeats this process. Nodes select preferred node as parent.
- At end of cycle, all nodes have a preferred path to root.

Sensor Network Routing fits use case of Wireless Mesh Routing
- Static, connected network.
- Additional issues: energy efficiency, duty cycling

Collection Tree Protocol
- A protocol for transferring data from one or more sensors to one or more root nodes.
- Uses ETX (or any other metric) to estimate link quality.
- Each packet contains data + node's estimate of ETX.
- Nodes can advertise themselves as collection point, with ETX = 0.
- Other nodes compute the lowest cost to their nearest collection collection point. ETX_node = ETX_parent + ETX_link.
    - ETX_node is computed by sending beacons to all neighbours. Beacons, unlike data, is broadcast.
    - When a node broadcasts its ETX estimate to neighbours, neighbours can decide whether to select the node as parent.
- **Adaptive Beaconing**: To minimise wasting resources broadcasting, they're done only when something is found to be amiss.
    - Start at frequency $T_0$, a very high frequency / short interval.
    - Similar to exponential backoff: if everything is fine, increase interval between beaconing.
- **Datapath Validation**: Reset frequency of sending beacons back to $T_0$ when: 
    - ETX_node found to be < ETX_parent. This suggests network is stale.
    - New node enters. This allows new node and neighbour nodes to quickly gather info.
    - When ETX suddenly degrades. This allows nodes to quickly find alternative path

RPL (Routing over low power and lossy networks)
- Can use either DV protocol or Source Routing Protocol
    - DV: Similar to DV below.
    - Source Routing: Allows sender to (partially or completely) specify route of packet.
- Maintains a Destination Oriented DAG.
    - One specific sink node.
    - Each node has a rank (closeness to sink)
    - Each node knows the parent, and sends message towards parent

Directed Diffusion
- Don't know if information exists or not.
    - Send query to express interest for information.
    - Neighbouring nodes now act as if they are the sink and forward query
    - Flooding stops when a source node can satisfy query.
    - Source node floods answer back to sink.
- Reinforce path by repeatedly sending query/answer through this path.
- Pros:
    - Works well with large amount of sensed events but few queries.
    - Large amounts of interest for the same data
    - Should find a path if one exists
- Cons:
    - Substantial communication overhead in discovery phase
    - Store a lot of status information (where from, where to)

Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR)
- Each node knows physical location of destination node.
- Each node greedily chooses node that is closest to destination.
- Pros:
    - Minimal overhead. Each node only needs to keep list of neighbour and locations.
- Cons:
    - Can get stuck in local minima and information cannot get out.

Hierarchical Routing
![](https://i.imgur.com/mG7vgWG.png)
- Report information to cluster head, which will report information to its cluster head etc.
- Only cluster heads need to perform additional computation like aggregation
- Assumes adjacent cluster members have similar data

Geographic Hash Table
- Use a node's location as a bucket for hashing.
- Hash(data) = (1.2, 4.5) --> store data in a node from coordinate (1,4).
- Lookup(data) --> Find it by broadcasting to all nodes in coordinate (1,4)
 
#### Ad-Hoc Routing
- **Mobile** wireless nodes.
- Issues:
    - Topology may change dynamically and unpredictably
    - Routing path may be available but needs to be discovered.
- Solutions
    - Proactive: When a packet needs to be forwarded, the route is already known. Table Driven protocols are one such example.
    - Reactive: Determine a route only when there is data to send. Source Initiated (on demand) procotols are one such example.

Table Driven Routing Protocols
- Each node maintains routing information to all other nodes in network.
- When topology changes, updates are propagated throughout the entire network
- Example: Destination Sequenced Distance Vector routing (DSDV)
    - Based on Bellman-Ford.
    - Each node maintains routing table to all other nodes
    - Routing table updates periodically transmitted (each node transmits its view of the network to its neighbours only)
    - Each entry marked by a sequence number to distinguish stale loops
    - Requires O(N) memory per node. Each node just needs to know: for each destination, which neighbour should I forward to (self -> A, let A deal with the rest).

Linked-state routing
- Based on Dijkstra
- Each node maintains full knowledge of the entire network topology.
- Each node propagates its link state (itself <-> neighbour) to the entire network
- All nodes in the network receive these updates and update their own topology map. Each node will also compute the best route between itself and any node in the network.
- Requires N^2 memory per node. Each node needs to know: for each destination, this is my plan (self -> A -> B -> ... -> destination) to get it to the destination.

Source-Initiated On-Demand
- Nodes not in a selected path don't maintain routing information or participate in routing table exchanges
- Source nodes initiates path discovery (when it has data to send) by sending a Route Request Packet to neighbours

### Delay Tolerant Network
- Nodes are mobile and mostly disconnected. Nodes only get to meet each other opportunistically. Nodes mostly in sleep mode to conserve power.
- Messages duplicated to many (if not all) nodes
- Constrained by:
    - Buffer size
    - Contact duration (might not be sufficient to transmit all buffered info)
- Examples:
    - Bus network, deep space network
- Two extremes:
    - Epidemic: send every packet to every node one encounters. Highest overhead. 
    - Single Copy: only send if you encounter the correct recipient.
- Some midpoints:
    - Epidemic variant: Optimise by using ACK messages (remove msg from buffer), only relay up to x times.
    - Single Copy variant: Relay the message to another node with probability p.

### Discovery in mobile network

Mobility
- No mobility: nodes are in the same location using same AP
- Mid mobility: connecting/disconnecting from multiple APs
- High mobility: Pass through multiple APs while maintaining ongoing connection

Terminologies
- Home network: permanent "home" of mobile device
    - Home Location Register: A database containing permanent cell phone number, profile information (e.g. customer name, billing, preferences etc), information about device current location.
- Home agent: entity (server) that will perform mobility functions on behalf of the mobile device when the device is remote.
- Permanent address: permanent "address" where anyone can use to find the mobile device.
- Visited Network: network where the mobile device currently resides
    - Visitor Location Register: Similar database with entry for each user currently in network.
- Care-of-address: temporary address issued by visited network to denote the mobile device
- Foreign agent: entity (server) that performs mobility function on the mobile device

Registration
- When a device visits a foreign network, it registers on the network. 
- Foreign network will update home network: "this mobile is now resident on my network".
- So home agent knows location of mobile; foreign agent authenticates and knows about mobile.

Mobility via Indirect Routing
- When a correspondent wants to communicate with mobile device, it will contact home network using mobile's permanent address.
- Home agent knows that mobile device is on foreign network. It intercepts packets and forwards to foreign agent.
- Foreign agent receives packets and forwards to mobile.
- Mobile replies directly to correspondent.
- Known as triangle routing. Packets must constantly go through this inefficient correspondent -> home -> foreign -> mobile.

Mobility via Direct Routing
- When a correspondent wants to communicate with mobile device, it will contact home network using mobile's permanent address.
- Home agent knows that mobile device is on foreign network. It tells correspondent to contact foreign network directly.
- Foreign agent receives packets and forwards to mobile.
- Mobile replies directly to correspondent.
- Non-transparent to correspondent.
- Becomes problematic if mobile changes visited network again. Then foreign agent now needs to act as anchor and forward.

Handoff with Mobile Switching Center
1. Old base station informs MSC of impending handoff. Provides list of new Base Stations.
2. MSC allocates resources to create path to new base station
3. New base station allocates resources (e.g. bandwidth/channel) for incoming device
4. New base station signals MSC & old base station: ready
5. Old base station asks mobile device to contact new base station
6. Mobile & New base station activate the new channel
7. Mobile signals (through new base station) to MSC that handoff is complete. MSC re-routes ongoing calls to use new base station
8. MSC and old base station releases unused resources

Handoff between MSCs
- MSCs must remain as anchor.
- Every time device visits new MSC, the new MSC will add on to the chain.
- Possible to use path compression to skip middle anchors

### Node Discovery
How to discover nodes when nodes aren't always on?

#### Synchronous Node discovery
- Symmetric Nodes
    - All nodes agree to wake up periodically / at the same time.
    - Can be expensive and synchronization (and re-synchronization) required to wake up at exactly the same time / correct for clock drift.
    - If too many nodes wake up at the same time, collision may increase.
- Asymmetric Nodes
    - One node is more powerful than the rest. e.g. WiFi APs
    - Rely on AP to be always awake.
    - Mobile device can broadcast probe beacon and listen for reply.
    - Alternatively AP can broadcast periodically and mobile reply.
    - Mobile periodically ping AP to check if there is new data intended for it.

#### Asynchronous Node Discovery
- Much harder as there is no time synchronization.
- Randomly waking up is very inefficient.
- Two nodes randomly choose to wake up k slots out of a total of n slots. Probability of waking up at the same slot at least once is given by
    - $Q(n, k) = 1 - \frac{{n-k}\choose{k}}{n\choose k}$
    - No worst case bound. Always possible to "never meet".
- Deterministic bound
